# SistemaConstancias

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.9.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run one of the following commands (choose your preferred package manager):

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun run start

# Using pnpm
pnpm run start

# Using Yarn
yarn run start

# Using npm
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun run ng generate component component-name

# Using pnpm
pnpm run ng generate component component-name

# Using Yarn
yarn run ng generate component component-name

# Using npm
npm run ng generate component component-name
```

**Note:** This project follows a convention of omitting the `.component` suffix in filenames. The generated files will be automatically adjusted to follow this pattern.

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun run ng generate --help

# Using pnpm
pnpm run ng generate --help

# Using Yarn
yarn run ng generate --help

# Using npm
npm run ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run one of the following commands:

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun run build

# Using pnpm
pnpm run build

# Using Yarn
yarn run build

# Using npm
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun run test

# Using pnpm
pnpm run test

# Using Yarn
yarn run test

# Using npm
npm run test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun run ng e2e

# Using pnpm
pnpm run ng e2e

# Using Yarn
yarn run ng e2e

# Using npm
npm run ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
